- 👋 Hi, I’m Ian
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, AI, machine learning, quant finance, trading, investing and financial market landscapes & analysis 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of Python and working towards applying them both in my professional capacity through financial risk modelling and have a desire to apply these new skills in my hobbies and interest (trading and investing)
- 💞️ I’m not currently looking to collaborate on anything yet, but as I progress on my journey, open to all possibilities.
